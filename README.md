# lift_prototype_project
This my embedded system project -lift_prototype_project
Recently started learning Embedded systems. So I created a basic prototype of Elevator in Proteus simulation software.
For this, I am using an ATmega16 8-bit microcontroller.
Working of the elevator -
There are two motors, first is the operating motor, which moves a Elevator up and down, and the second motor opens and closes the door.
Here I am using two 7segment displays, the red one shows the current floor, and the blue one shows the desired floor.
If user don't press any button for 10 seconds, then by default, the Elevator will reach the 1st floor.
